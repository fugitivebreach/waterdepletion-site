# 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide

## Water Depletion Project - Railway Hosting

This guide will help you deploy your Water Depletion school project to Railway for free hosting.

### 📋 Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account** - You'll need a GitHub account to connect with Railway
2. **Railway Account** - Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. **Git** - Make sure Git is installed on your computer

### 🛠️ Deployment Steps

#### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it something like `water-depletion-project`
3. Make it **public** (required for Railway free tier)
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have files)

#### Step 2: Upload Your Project to GitHub

Open your terminal/command prompt in your project folder and run:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial commit - Water Depletion Project"

# Add your GitHub repository as origin (replace with your actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/water-depletion-project.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

#### Step 3: Deploy on Railway

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click **"Start a New Project"**
3. Choose **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Connect your GitHub account if not already connected
5. Select your `water-depletion-project` repository
6. Railway will automatically detect it's a Python project and deploy it!

#### Step 4: Access Your Live Website

1. Once deployment is complete, Railway will provide you with a URL
2. It will look something like: `https://your-project-name.up.railway.app`
3. Your website is now live and accessible to anyone!

### 📁 Files Created for Railway

- **`railway.json`** - Railway configuration
- **`Procfile`** - Tells Railway how to run your app
- **`requirements.txt`** - Updated with production dependencies
- **`app.py`** - Updated for production environment

### 🎯 Features

Your deployed website will have:
- ✅ **Loading screen** with dependency simulation
- ✅ **Water measurement system** with animated water level
- ✅ **LED text animations** in blue color scheme
- ✅ **Faucet cursor animation** with water particles
- ✅ **Citations section** with your references
- ✅ **Responsive design** for all devices
- ✅ **Modern black theme** with professional styling

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails:**
1. Check that all files are committed to GitHub
2. Make sure `requirements.txt` is present
3. Verify `app.py` doesn't have syntax errors

**If website doesn't load:**
1. Check Railway logs in the dashboard
2. Make sure the PORT environment variable is being used
3. Verify all static files (CSS, JS) are being served correctly

### 💡 Tips

- **Free tier limits**: Railway free tier has usage limits but should be fine for a school project
- **Custom domain**: You can add a custom domain in Railway settings if desired
- **Updates**: Push changes to GitHub and Railway will automatically redeploy

### 🎓 Perfect for School Projects

Your water depletion project is now professionally hosted and can be:
- Shared with teachers and classmates
- Included in presentations
- Accessed from any device with internet
- Used as a portfolio piece

**Your project URL will be something like:**
`https://water-depletion-project.up.railway.app`

Enjoy your live water depletion awareness website! 🌊
